The **Guess the Number** program is a console-based Java application where players guess a number randomly generated by the system. It includes features like:

1. Random number generation between 1 and 100.
2. Limited attempts for guessing the number.
3. Multiple rounds (default: 3).
4. Scoring based on remaining attempts.
5. Feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low.

This simple yet fun project helps improve basic programming skills and logic building.
